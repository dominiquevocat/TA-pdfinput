WHITE PAPERSplunk, Big Data and the Future of SecurityThe Changing Nature 
of Security Threats 
Current IT security tools and mindsets are no longer 
adequate to meet the scope and complexity of 
today’s threats. Internet security has evolved over the 
last ten years but advanced persistent threats and 
the sophistication of the malware have fundamentally 
changed the way security teams must think about 
these new threats and the tools used for detective 
controls.

The Evolution of the IT Security Infrastructure
Over the years, security teams have moved from simply 
protecting the IT infrastructure perimeter with traditional 
defenses (firewalls), anti-virus and intrusion detection systems 
(IDS). They have employed sophisticated IDS to prevent attacks 
and we watched as these evolved into intrusion prevention 
systems (IPS). Even with this level of protection, it was not 
possible to track all the events that security teams saw from 
the security architecture and many of the IDS events were 
false-positives. Security event management systems (SEM), 
which correlate data from these systems, evolved to reduce the 
workload using correlation rules to reduce false-positives, alert 
on possible threats and provide some visualizations and canned 
reports that reflect some security metrics.

“…There is now a fairly accepted consensus that the technology 
(AV, IPS, and Firewalls) aiming to keep malicious actors at bay isn’t 
completely successful.”
Chris Silva, 
IANS Trend Report 20111

As use of the web and email for business exploded, over 
time (and in no particular order) web proxy, email security, 
vulnerability assessment, database security were added to 
monitor possible attacks, understand what systems were 
unpatched and vulnerable, and prevent the spread of viruses and 
malware on systems. This deluge of data proved too much for 
the SEM and the security Information management system (SIM) 
was introduced to reduce the workload on the SEM by collecting, 
normalizing and storing data from the security architecture 
sending a subset of this data to the SEM. 

This combination SIM/SEM technology and any required 
collection agents became referred to as the security information 
and event management system (SIEM) and continued the data-
reduction or data-distilling strategy first introduced by the SEM. 
This architecture is usually visually represented as the funnel: 
Information is gathered from a wide variety of signature-based 
systems and operating systems and a sub-set of the collected 
data is sent to the SEM and correlated using a rule-based system 
focused on known threats such as classic perimeter-based 
attacks over open ports or brute force attacks.

As many businesses realized that a majority of data exfiltration 
happened when employees were not happy or left the company, 
data loss prevention (DLP) was added. Also during this time, due 
to the business scandals of the late ‘90s and early 2000s, access 
controls and system monitoring was mandated and regulatory 
compliance became a cost of doing business. Funding shifted 
from security to compliance and vendors rushed to create more 
canned reports “chasing the money.” 

While the SIEM “funnel” or data reduction approach was 
helpful in reducing the amount of data the team had to analyze 
to recognize attacks, attackers exploited the fact that the 
security team had only a subset of all data to work with due 
to data scalability issues. In addition, silos remained between 
IT operations, IT security and development teams in large 
IT organizations. Applications closest to the core business 
product or service mission were monitored by IT operations or 
applications teams or in some instances not at all. Developers 
created applications that either didn’t log or logged in ways 
that were only understood by the developers and that were not 
standardized. This data was not able to be included in a SIEM 
view due to complexity or expense. 

Not having access to application data meant that security teams 
had a blind spot for risks to the business as malware and viruses 
that took advantage of undisclosed or zero-day application layer, 
the lack of context for security incidents, and silos between 
teams that increased incident response times. 

Exploiting Trust
Today, who we are, what we do, and who we know is available on 
LinkedIn, Facebook and other social networking sites. A simple 
search on Google can reveal our PowerPoint presentations and 
the conferences we’ve attended. Today attackers target the most 
vulnerable point in the network—exploiting human trust using 
spear phishing. The exposure to today’s sophisticated advanced 
persistent threat (APT)-style attacks and the pervasive presence 
of malware is a harsh wake up call for many IT organizations. 
According to Kevin Mandia of Mandiant Inc., “…there are 
thousands of companies compromised—actively, right now,”2 
with highly sophisticated malware that has yet to be discovered 
deposited by persistent attackers. 

An appropriate analogy of this new style of targeted attack 
would be the difference between a car thief that wanders around 
parking lots at a variety of locations looking for cars that may 
be unlocked with keys left behind the visor, versus a thief that 
wants your specific car. The latter type of thief decides to follow 
you around for weeks or months, watching your habits, learning 
where you live and getting to know who you talk to, where you 
go and who you know. He then introduces himself to you at 
a party as a co-worker of one of your best friends in another 
department and then asks to borrow your car. 

The “data-thief” you linked to on Linkedin wasn’t really a long 
forgotten coworker but someone you’ve never met who knows 
you very well. The ‘data-thief’ sends you an email with a PDF 
attachment called “organizational changes” that contains zero-
day exploit code. With one click, your system is ”owned” and 
your email, private information, your website content or other 
company intellectual property data is potentially compromised.

WHITE PAPERlisten to your dataWhat’s worse is if you happen to have admin rights to your 
system and stored credentials on your computer to other critical 
applications on the network. The deposited malware can change 
settings on your Windows group policy object and change the 
Windows DLL startup order, guaranteeing that the malware 
will start at boot time and stay persistent. It can also replace or 
switch on a little used networking service to spread the malware 
to other systems. This type of malware may also stay resident 
but dormant on several other systems as a backup in case the 
first compromised system is found. Each of these steps may take 
place several days or weeks apart. 

While the threat landscape has changed, the mindset of the 
security team has remained focused on a conventional approach 
to security dealing with known threats, which includes:

•	 Protecting all information assets

•	 Maintaining controls that are primarily signature-based and 

preventative

•	 Paying the most attention to the egress points in the 

network

•	 Collecting logs for compliance and post incident forensics

•	 Getting smart on the current malware threats

•	 Finding and removing malware and infections

•	 Preserving the network: a successful outcome defined as 

no attackers get in.3

Our Overdependence on SIEM
With hundreds of variants to social engineering-based scenarios, 
many ways to compromise a system, zero-day vulnerabilities in 
applications and operating systems and thousands of malware 
variants, what are the odds that one of your 200+ SIEM rules will 
fire and alert you to a problem? “Traditional security information 
event management (SIEM) systems typically don’t detect a 
relentless targeted attack designed to avoid raising any red flags: 
they’re tuned to catch unusual activity, not stealthy attacks that 
hide behind legitimate user credentials or normal traffic.”4

“‘Can I be compromised?’ is no longer the right question to be 
asking.”
Jason Rebholz, 
Mandiant, 2011

If we are lucky, and a piece of our security infrastructure finds a 
compromised host with persistent malware, we declare victory, 
clean or re-image the affected host and are satisfied with our 
success. Most SIEMs act in a serial fashion—the security event 
detected at the SIEM level is presented to us as the “end-of-the-
story” supported by evidence from signature based systems. 
With this approach, the SIEM will not tell us that the security 
event that was alerted on was really compromised host number 
117 and that the attack really started with a different host over 
a year ago. The information to support this possibility has long 
since passed into the history books. The SIEM is not architected 
in a way that will let you easily re-examine an old attack from 

listen to your data

a year ago with new information. In July of 2011, McAfee 
announced that it had found active malware deposited on systems 
in 2006. Re-analyzing five years of log data is outside the reach of 
traditional SIEM and more suited for a big-data solution. 

“Most security software prevents or detects a high number of 
known threats. While you need to have these capabilities in 
order to detect the botnets and viruses that cause interruptions 
to your organization’s daily operations, they miss the advanced 
threats being used to target your most sensitive information. 
Additionally, much of this software — although not all of it — is 
designed to limit your control over what threats are detected, 
how the detection occurs and when you remediate.”5

When the attacker sees that one of their “owned” hosts is no 
longer available, the attacker does their own post mortem on the 
discovered host and shifts tactics to get more firmly embedded 
on hosts in the network. New command and control instructions 
are sent to other dormant malware on hosts on the network and 
the persistent attack continues.

The Implications of New Modus Operandi
The attacker wants their malware to behave like a normal 
application so that log data doesn’t cause any security systems 
alarms. If an attacker knows you well and establishes trust with 
you over a real or imagined long period of time, then there’s 
a good chance you will follow a request of an attacker telling 
you to check out a website, click on an attachment or give to a 
charity that needs help now (and pay with a credit card). 

Because of the current mindset, security professionals always 
find these words hard to admit: completely preventing these 
kinds of attacks is futile. However, in the current environment, 
the security team can work to minimize the damage by quickly 
spotting new user or machine patterns of behavior in very large 
data sets that may be worth investigating. 

Thinking Like an Attacker to Find 
Unknown Threats
For years security professionals have been in reactive mode 
when a security threat was recognized. As a threat was 
recognized, the team was dispatched to deal with what was 
detected. If it was determined that the issue was with a user’s 
behavior, the team would try to educate the user about the 
importance of data protection and move on to the next problem. 
But for each incident the team was able to address, there were 
others that went undetected. The current security tool sets by 
design (including SIEM) have us thinking like a victim and not like 
an attacker. To understand the full scope of an attack we need to 
start thinking like an attacker. 

Thinking like an attacker means you must understand: 

•	 Asset and data criticality

•	 Location of the most important company data assets

•	 Ways your systems and data can be accessed

•	 Means by which malware can be spread in the organization

•	 Means by which malware can be made persistent

•	 Who might be the most “attractive” victims, what level 

they are in the enterprise and what data they might have 
access to

3

WHITE PAPERlisten to your data•	 Knowing what would be considered unusual accesses to 

important data based on time, frequency or location 

•	 Discovery of a single compromised host should not end the 

security investigation

Mandiant’s “Anatomy of a Hack”

Understanding the attacker means monitoring large data sets of 
normal user activity data looking for patterns of activity that are 
not normal in context of time, place, or appropriateness. This has 
given rise to a new role on the security team called the security 
intelligence analyst.6 These individuals: 

•	 Take the “actor view” to understand the identities, goals 

and methods of potential adversaries

•	 Work with management, lines of business and operations 

personnel—this knowledge makes them aware of the 
threats posed by persistent adversaries 

•	 Assess actions and determine if a pattern of threatening 

behavior is emerging

•	 Map and visualize threat behavior patterns against big-

data sets of normal IT activities with analytics

“The core of the most effective [APT] response appears to 
be a new breed of security analytics that help quickly detect 
anomalous patterns—basically power tools in the hands of a 
new and important sub-category of data scientists: the security 
analytics expert.” 7

APT style attacks have de-positioned SIEM moving it from a 
solution to simply a tool for monitoring mainly known threats. 

“Because adversaries are intelligent, well funded and patient, they 
can afford to take weeks to probe their targets and months to plant 
malware inside the organizations in order to exfiltrate data.” 
Chris Silva, 
IANS Trend Report 2011 8

Dealing with Unknown Threats Using 
Big Data and Analytics
Just as businesses use business intelligence solutions to monitor 
large amounts of customer data and watch for patterns that 
allow them to better understand customer behavior, security 
professionals need similar solutions for the infrastructure. 

They need to monitor network, host, and application behaviors 
in a contextual way across IT data to understand the depth and 
breadth of persistent malware in the IT environment. 

“There are some emerging use cases for information security which 
can only be handled with big data capabilities.”
Neil MacDonald, 
Gartner, April 12, 2011

Enter Splunk—The First Big Data System 
for Security
Splunk Enterprise is the engine for machine data. Splunk 
software enables enterprises to gain operational intelligence 
by monitoring, reporting and analyzing real-time machine data 
as well as terabytes of historical data located on-premise or in 
the cloud. With Splunk you can leverage an analytics command 
language to map and visualize any potential attack scenario 
against the business’ most important data assets. These 
scenarios can be easily aligned with the business risk-based 
modus operandi of potential attackers. Automated searches can 
continuously monitor for abnormal patterns of behavior in host, 
network and application data. Combined with an understanding 
of where critical data is stored, who should have access to it, 
time based analysis of typical user behavior (i.e., how much 
mail is sent per day, normal data access times, physical access 
and normal host network behaviors), abnormal patterns can be 
detected. Adaptive monitoring of the active phase of the attack 
over time presents opportunities to detect abnormal behaviors 
on hosts and networks. 

“Splunk has approximately 3,000 customers, the vast majority 
of which are using Splunk to solve big data problems—providing 
operational intelligence to make machine data accessible, usable, 
and valuable.
Frank Sparacino, 
First Analysis, September 15, 2011

Specific sets of automated Splunk searches of normal user 
activities may comprise multiple scenarios. A single search 
can trigger several other searches in a decision tree fashion 
and could confirm the existence and spread of malware. An 
anomalous behavior detected can be analyzed along with other 
time-sequenced IT data and changes to host configuration files. 
Old security events can and should be reviewed and reanalyzed 
on a regular basis as a means of preventing re-infestation and 
as a way of determining whether the first compromised victim 
found was the only one, the first one or victim 112.

WHITE PAPERlisten to your dataattackers--can move the security team from a conventional 
approach to a more flexible and advanced approach more 
suitable for the newest security threats. Best practices of this 
new approach include:

•	 Focus efforts on most important data business assets

•	 Use detective controls linked to data analytics watching for 

behavioral outliers

•	 Seek, model and dissect attack patterns

•	 Develop deep understanding of attackers’ modus 

operandi in context of the organization’s key assets and IT 
environments

•	 Realize that attackers will sometimes get in, but are 

detected quickly and impact (risk) is minimized

The security team’s creativity and imagination are supported 
through ad-hoc exploration of data and modeling of attacks 
based on business risk. This allows security teams to speculate 
on potential attack vectors in advance of any actual attack. 
Different critical alerts can be created to support a search that 
has found a particular issue on one host versus another. 

Dealing with Known Threats
While the focus of this paper is a discussion of a new paradigm 
and a new way of thinking about detecting unknown threats, it is 
not meant to be a condemnation of practices around monitoring 
known threats. Script-kiddies and canned attack tools are still 
out there. There is a still a need to monitor security operational 
metrics for continuous improvement. System patching, IPS 
attacks, firewall accepts/denies, DNS logs, data loss prevention 
(DLP) systems, anti-virus and other endpoint security systems 
should still be monitored.

Splunk offers alternatives to users who would typically purchase 
a SIEM to monitor their security infrastructure only monitoring 
known threats. Splunk (as of this writing) offers over 30 security 
apps free of charge that can monitor specific security point 
problems. Splunk also offers the Splunk App for Enterprise 
Security, which monitors over 100 security metrics, provides 
over 160 reports, identity correlation and a complete set of the 
most important correlation searches to offer SIEM functionality. 
It includes incident workflows and supports drill-down into raw 
data as well as workflow actions to launch cross data-type views 
of incident data. Just as with the core Splunk product, real-time 
alerts can be generated. 

Summary–Reaching for Security Intelligence 
Finding anomalous patterns in massive data sets over time and 
in context for unknown threats is the key to detecting advanced 
persistent attackers and the malware they leave behind. SIEMs 
that are set up to monitor security infrastructure watching for 
known threats do not solve the APT problem and have security 
teams in constant cleanup mode thinking like the victim and not 
like the attacker. Only big-data solutions with strong analytics 
and visualization capabilities can provide insight into anomalous 
behavior. 

W H I T E   P A P E R

Security teams need to start using their creativity to think 
about the modus operandi of the attacker and work with the 
business, assigning risk to data. Thinking like an attacker and 
modeling attacks that start with spear-phishing against the most 
important business assets aligns the security team with business 
objectives through prioritization of data assets and risk. This 
type of thinking is a valued skill. 

Splunk is a security intelligence solution for monitoring large 
datasets and gives you the ability to tell the difference between 
humans interacting with IT systems and behaviors that may 
be caused by malware. Splunk can cover known threats via 
information from signature and rule-based systems but also can 
be used to monitor for unknown threats based on risk-based 
scenarios translated into Splunk’s analytics language.
